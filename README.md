## Data Interactives

This a quick repository containing code for small interactive pieces showcasing 
smaller UI web elements in data storytelling.
<br><br>
A couple quick things to note:
- A lot of the data is mock data and only serves the purpose of showing how the charts/interactives are rooted in data.
- The code is by no means the <i>best</i> way to achieve the intended outcome -It just showcases how I went about it.
